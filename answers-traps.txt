1.  a2 register holds 13 while a1 register holds 12
2.  The instruction:   
    li	a1,12
    actually inline the functions f and g and then loads the result which equals to 12 into a1 register
3.  000000000000066a
4.  0000000000000038
5.  Output: HE110 World
    If RISC-V is big-endian, we should set i = 0x726c6400
    No need to change 57616 to a different value
6.  The value in a2 register. (The answer is not a specific value since we don't know what's the value of a2 reg at that time.)
