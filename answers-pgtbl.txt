The purpose of this shared page we maintain in proc is that when we want to read
some contents in user space after storing the contents in this shared page with
PTE_U permission, we don't need to trap into kernel space.

We can also store other infomations of process in this shared page but I think
many syscalls are trying to get dynamic informations so we may make the shared
page writable.
