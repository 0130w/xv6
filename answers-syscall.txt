1.  usertrap() function in kernel/trap.c calls syscall() 
    function in kernel/syscall.c

2.  p→trapframe→a7 = 0x7 which equals to the syscall number of `exec`

3.  User mode

4.  instruction code: 
    lw     a3,0(zero)
    a3 register corresponds to num

5.  The reason of kernel crashed is that we try to dereference the value at
    address 0, which is used for placing PCIE devices.

6.  binary name: initcode, pid = 1
